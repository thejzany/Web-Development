    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing to formally request a leave of absence from October 5, 2023 to October 20, 2023 due to my sister's wedding, which is
        scheduled during this period.

        During my absence, I will ensure that any pending tasks or responsibilities are either completed or handed over
        to a colleague to minimize any disruptions. I understand the importance of maintaining workflow and will be
        accessible for work-related matters, if necessary, during my leave.

        I have attached the wedding invitation and other relevant details to this application for your reference. If
        there are any further forms or procedures that need to be completed, please let me know, and I will promptly
        provide the required information.

        I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition during my absence and will make every effort to ensure that my
        leave does not adversely affect the team's productivity. I will also provide my contact information in case of
        any emergencies or urgent matters that may require my attention.

        I kindly request your approval for this leave request and hope that you can grant me the time off as specified.
        If you need any further information or have any questions regarding this request, please do not hesitate to
        contact me at 986754321 or via email at abc@mail.com

        Thank you for considering my request. I appreciate your understanding and support in this matter.
