        <dd><i>"Chai" typically refers to a type of tea, specifically a spiced tea that originated in India. It is also
                known as "masala chai," where "masala" means a mixture of spices. Chai is made by brewing black tea with
                a combination of aromatic spices and herbs, usually including ingredients like black tea leaves,
                cardamom,
                cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and black peppercorns. The exact blend of spices can vary depending on
                regional
                preferences and individual recipes.</i></dd>
